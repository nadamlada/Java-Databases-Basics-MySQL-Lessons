7.	SoftUni Design
Create an E/R Diagram of the SoftUni Database. There are some special relations you should check out: employees are self-referenced (manager_id) and departments have One-to-One with the employees (manager_id) while the employees have One-to-Many (department_id). You might find it interesting how it looks on а diagram. 
