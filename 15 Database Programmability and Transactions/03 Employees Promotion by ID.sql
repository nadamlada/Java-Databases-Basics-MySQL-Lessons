/*
3. Employees Promotion by ID
Write a stored procedure usp_raise_salary_by_id(id) that raises a given employee's salary (by id as parameter) by 5%. Consider that you cannot promote an employee that doesn't exist â€“ if that happens, no changes to the database should be made. Submit your queries using the "MySQL Run Skeleton, run queries and check DB" strategy. 

Example
The following example is given with employee_id  =  17.
salary
14175.0000
