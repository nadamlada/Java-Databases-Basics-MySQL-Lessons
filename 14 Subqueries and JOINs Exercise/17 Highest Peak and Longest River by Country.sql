/*
17.  Highest Peak and Longest River by Country
For each country, find the elevation of the highest peak and the length of the longest river, sorted by the highest peak_elevation (from highest to lowest), then by the longest river_length (from longest to smallest), then by country_name (alphabetically). Display NULL when no data is available in some of the columns. Limit only the first 5 rows.

Example
country_name	highest_peak_elevation	longest_river_length
China	8848	6300
India	8848	3180
Nepal	8848	2948
Pakistan	8611	3180
Argentina	6962	4880
