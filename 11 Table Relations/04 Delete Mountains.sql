/*
4.	Delete Mountains
Drop tables from the task 1.
Write a query to create a one-to-many relationship between a table, holding information about 
mountains (id, name) and other - about peaks (id, name, mountain_id), so that when a mountain 
gets removed from the database, all his peaks are deleted too.
Submit your queries using the "MySQL run queries & check DB" strategy.
